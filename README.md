# Final Spinner

A fun and interactive spinner created using Python's Turtle module. Press the spacebar to flick the spinner and watch it spin!

## Project Description

This project involves creating a spinner using the Turtle graphics library in Python. The spinner responds to user input (spacebar key press) to increase its spinning speed. It gradually slows down due to simulated friction.

## Features

- Interactive spinner that reacts to spacebar presses.
- Uses the Turtle graphics library to draw and animate the spinner.
- Adjustable spinner color.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Turtle module (part of the Python standard library)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.

### Usage

    python main.py
    ```

2. Press the spacebar to flick the spinner and make it spin faster.

### Example

The spinner starts in a static position. When you press the spacebar, it will start spinning. Each subsequent spacebar press will increase its speed.
